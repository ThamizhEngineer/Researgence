A methodical screening study as a function of changing Donor and Acceptor/anchoring groups have been performed with such dyes. The discrepancy in optoelectronic properties of the free dyes are initially calculated based on the different donors and anchors and the best donor groups are selected for the dye/TiO2 calculations for each anchoring groups. Detailed studies of the charge transfer properties, light harvesting efficiencies (LHE) and driving forces dye regeneration, charge recombination like electron injection are performed with first-principles calculations leading to new designed drugs with better driving force for azo based dye sensitized solar cells. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

    "abstract": "Abstract: Attempts to understand and interpret the inherent phenomena of liquid crystalline materials have changed the scenario of condensed matter physics. These liquid crystals gained importance due to shear with interatomic forces of neighboring atoms due to change in temperature, responsible for phase transitions with textures. In particular shear forces responsible liquid crystalline textures arise due to bonding, columbic attractive forces and hard core repulsive forces between the neighboring atoms that prevent the atoms to occupy their atomic regular sites. The focus of article attempts underlying microscopic phenomena of synthesized liquid crystalline substances with vibration studies and Frontier molecular orbital (FMO) contours. Vibration studies these compounds were interpreted for bonding with shifts in wave numbers of infrared spectra. Shear forces responsible for liquid crystalline nature were interpreted with electron density method, B3LYP method using 6-311G++ (d,p) basis set © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",

    "abstract": "Abstract: Oxadiazoles are heterocyclic compounds in numerous approved, and experimental drugs, bioactive molecules, liquid crystals, diodes and in solar cell applications. It is one of the primary molecules studied in recent times and is a vital molecule employed in medicinal-chemistry for the preparation of anticancer, anti-HIV, anti-TB, anti-hepatitis etc. Research in the chemistry of the oxadiazole derivatives has been developed with the evolution of each application area and the need for target molecules with specific properties. A large number of in vivo applications for the oxadiazole analogues have also been performed. Presently, it has also been introduced as both auxiliary acceptor and spacer in dye-sensitized solar cell study with significant efficiency. Extensive literature has been documented the different applications of this versatile scaffold. The current review described some critical synthetic approaches to form such a vital moiety along with its derivatives and discussed its diverse applications, which includes the moiety in pharmacological activities, diode, liquid crystal, and solar cell fields. The review also describes some advancement in the field from our group, and also, the scope of the further study has been introduced. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",

    "abstract": "SARS-COV-2, the novel coronavirus and root of global pandemic COVID-19 caused a severe health threat throughout the world. Lack of specific treatments raised an effort to find potential inhibitors for the viral proteins. The recently invented crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) and its key role in viral replication; non-resemblance to any human protease makes it a perfect target for inhibitor research. This article reports a computer-aided drug design (CADD) approach for the screening of 118 compounds with 16 distinct heterocyclic moieties in comparison with 5 natural products and 7 repurposed drugs. Molecular docking analysis against Mpro protein were performed finding isatin linked with a oxidiazoles (A2 and A4) derivatives to have the best docking scores of −11.22 kcal/mol and −11.15 kcal/mol respectively. Structure-activity relationship studies showed a good comparison with a known active Mpro inhibitor and repurposed drug ebselen with an IC50 value of −0.67 μM. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations for 50 ns were performed for A2 and A4 supporting the stability of the two compounds within the binding pocket, largely at the S1, S2 and S4 domains with high binding energy suggesting their suitability as potential inhibitors of Mpro for SARS-CoV-2. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",
